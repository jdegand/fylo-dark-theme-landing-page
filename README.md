## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The background variation shows the problem of using margin & padding interchangeably. 
- Better to use padding on top level elements and margin on inner level elements  

### Continued development

- Accessibility / Improve Semantic HTML
- Account for bold on hover layout shift
- (Mobile) background variation is tough to discern.  
- Footer - align sections better
